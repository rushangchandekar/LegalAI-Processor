## 🧑‍💻 Overview

**Team:** LegalAI Innovators  
**Team Lead:** Atharva Donadkar

Agentic Legal Intelligence System leverages six AI agents running on Google Cloud to process contracts, agreements, and legal texts faster and more reliably than any manual review [file:1]. The platform enables plain-language summaries, audit-friendly cryptographic provenance tracking, automated risk assessments, and multilingual support—making legal expertise accessible to everyone [file:1].

## 🎯 Features

- Multi-Format Document Ingestion: Accepts PDF, DOCX, TXT, and scanned images with OCR and confidence scoring [file:1].
- Legal Entity Extraction: Automatically identifies parties, dates, obligations, penalties, and key contract terms [file:1].
- Plain-Language Summaries: Converts complex legal text into language understandable by non-lawyers [file:1].
- Natural Language Q&A: Users can ask questions about their documents in plain English and get contextual answers instantly [file:1].
- Risk Assessment: Provides risk ratings and confidence metrics for each interpretation [file:1].
- 100 Language Support: Automated and legally accurate translation of documents to make global contracts accessible [file:1].
- Cryptographic Provenance Tracking: Verifiable, token-level alignment between source and interpretation—complete audit trails for compliance [file:1].
- Enterprise-Grade Security: VPC isolation, CMEK encryption, SOC2/GDPR compliance, and immutable audit logs [file:1].

## ⚙️ How It Works

Six specialized agents process your uploaded documents in sequence:
1. Ingestion & Format Handling
2. Legal Entity Extraction
3. Simplification & Plain-Language Translation
4. Natural Language Question Answering
5. Risk Assessment & Confidence Scoring
6. Cryptographic Signing & Audit Logging [file:1]

This multi-agent, modular architecture enables infinite scalability across legal domains and languages, with fast (30 seconds) document turnaround [file:1].
